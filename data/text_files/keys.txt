    Company Key
        - Used by Company-level Clients (e.g., Travelden, Finchglow, etc.)
        - Enables access to endpoints for managing agencies, branches, currencies, and      consolidated records.


    Agency Key
        - Used by Agency-level Clients (e.g., Touch Down Travels).
        - Enables agency-level access (e.g., their bookings, flight rules, and customers).



    Middleware Logic:
    The middleware currently:
        - Detects the type of key (Company or Agency).
        - Determines authorization scope.
        - Routes accordingly to service endpoints.
